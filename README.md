## Inspiration
NourishNet is a website which is inspired by daily Fitness freaks who face issues regarding calorie tracking and having a healthy diet. So here we come up with a solution to provide a medium where users can track their calories along with providing them with the latest information and resources on health and wellness.

## What it does
NourishNet is a website that generally provides information and resources related to health, fitness, and overall diet also get an option to calculate and manage of diet and calories. It offers various content such as articles/Blogs on having a healthy diet, Yoga tutorials, healthy recipes, a Calorie tracker, and Meal Planner.  The website may also feature tools such as calculators and trackers to help users monitor and improve their own diet and Health.

## How we built it
We build the Website using the MERN stack 
- Mongodb
- Express
- React
- Node

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into were Authentication and Authorization since it was our first project where we decided to have an Authorization process atlas we were not able to accomplish it rather we started working on making it more user-friendly in the due span of time also there is a delay in request to get received since we are using a free server(2-3 sec). 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
How the final website turned out, we like how the site is as functional as we originally expected it to be. We are proud that we had fun in the process and we met each other and we will work together outside of this hackathon!

## What we learned
Learned how to use netlify (for hosting), MongoDB for the backend, express.js, and how to integrate both the frontend and backend part in a Full-fledge website/.

## What's next for NourishNet
In terms of features, we aspire to add other functionality having tips for managing stress and improving mental health along with having a separate section on forums and online communities where users can connect with others and share information.
